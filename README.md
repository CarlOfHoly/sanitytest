# Hello and welcome to this cource in Sanity and Next.js
## If you want to code along, please complete step 1 to 6 before the workshop.

> Enviroment requirements: 
> * node version 16.14.2 -> https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.14.2/node-v16.14.2.pkg 
> * vscode -> https://code.visualstudio.com/


### Step 1. Create an account and a project on Sanity

First, [create an account on Sanity](https://sanity.io).

After creating an account, install the Sanity cli from npm `npm i -g @sanity/cli`.

### Step 2. Create a new Sanity project

In a the studio folder run `sanity init` to initialize a new studio project.

This will be where we manage our data.

When going through the init phase make sure to select **Yes** to the **Use the default dataset configuration** step and select **Clean project with no predefined schemas** for the **Select project template** step.

### Step 3. Generate an API token

Log into https://manage.sanity.io/ and choose the project you just created. Then from **Settings**, select **API**, then click **Add New Token** and create a token with the **Read** permission.

### Step 4. Set up environment variables in the web folder

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set each variable on `.env.local`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` should be the `projectId` value from the `sanity.json` file created in step 2.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` should be the `dataset` value from the `sanity.json` file created in step 2 - defaults to `production` if not set.
- `SANITY_API_TOKEN` should be the API token generated in the previous step.
- `SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET` can be any random string (but avoid spaces), like `MY_SECRET` - this is used for [Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode).

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=...
SANITY_API_TOKEN=...
SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET=...
```




### Step 5. Populate Content

To add some content go to your Sanity studio project directory and run `sanity start`.

After the project has started and you have navigated to the URL given in the terminal, select **Author** and create a new record.

- You just need **1 Author record**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- For the image, you can download one from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

Next, select **Post** and create a new record.

- We recommend creating at least **2 Post records**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- You can write markdown for the **Content** field.
- For the images, you can download ones from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
- Pick the **Author** you created earlier.

**Important:** For each post record, you need to click **Publish** after saving. If not, the post will be in the draft state.

### Step 6. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
